                    <h3>Security of remote payments</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <span>All aggregators and payment systems strictly monitor the security of transactions. Most payment services use a combination of several technologies in order to protect customers' funds as much as possible. The most popular are:</span>
    
                        <li>
                            <strong>Verified by Visa.</strong>
                            <span>This is a technology that ensures the reliability of payments in online stores. When making a purchase, the buyer is redirected to the website of the bank that issued the card. The user needs to enter a special code or password that was given to him when connecting to the Verified by Visa service.</span>
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            <strong>MasterCard SecureCode.</strong>
                            <span>This technology is similar to the one offered by Visa. The buyer needs to enter a secret password that allows you to authenticate the bank's client and make a payment.</span>
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            <strong>PCI DSS.</strong>
                            <span>This is a certificate that all structures working with payment cards must receive. The PCI DSS standard describes the requirements that apply to data protection. The standard strictly regulates the rules for the development of payment systems, infrastructure operation and other aspects. Most often, large online stores undergo certification, since this procedure costs about 20 thousand euros.</span>
